                    <i>Brownies are thought to originally come from the US,</i> the name was derived from the mythical characters in children's stories of the time. 
                    <u>One story suggests that brownies were created at the Palmer house in Chicago in 1892.</u>The first recipe for brownies comes from the 1896 Boston Cooking School Cookbook for molasses cakes baked in individual pans.
                    <b>Chocolate brownies didn't actually become popular until the 1920s,</b> when chocolate was more available to everyone.
                    Early recipes were made with <b>butter, eggs, sugar, flour, melted chocolate, and nuts.</b> Even though the recipe was published 100 years ago it's barely changed.
