                <i>Brownies are thought to originally come from the US,</i> the name was derived from the mythical characters in children's stories of the time. 
                <u>One story suggests that brownies were created at the Palmer house in Chicago in 1892.</u>The first recipe for brownies comes from the 1896 Boston Cooking School Cookbook for molasses cakes baked in individual pans.
                <b>Chocolate brownies didn't actually become popular until the 1920s,</b> when chocolate was more available to everyone.
                Early recipes were made with <b>butter, eggs, sugar, flour, melted chocolate, and nuts.</b> Even though the recipe was published 100 years ago it's barely changed.

                These homemade brownies will be super fudgy, moist, with crispy edges and tops. 
                For this recipe you won't need more than basic cooking necessities with the exception of unsweetened cocoa powder which you would probably have to go shopping for.
                These brownies take around an hour to make, including set up and clean up too. super fudgy, moist, and chocolaty, with crispy edges and crackly tops.
